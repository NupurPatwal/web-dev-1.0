    <h1>Iron Man</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        <a href="www.google.com">click me</a>Iron Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Co-created by writer and
        editor Stan Lee, developed by scripter Larry Lieber, and designed by artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby, the
        character first appeared in Tales of Suspense #39 in 1963, and received his own title with Iron Man #1 in 1968.
        Shortly after his creation, Iron Man was a founding member of a superhero team, the Avengers, with Thor,
        Ant-Man, the Wasp, and the Hulk. Iron Man stories, individually and with the Avengers, have been published
        consistently since the character's creation.</p>
    <h2>Publication history</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>Creation and premiere</h3>
    <p>Following the success of the Fantastic Four in 1961 and the subsequent revival of American comic books featuring
        superheroes, Marvel Comics set about creating new superhero characters. During this time, Stan Lee developed the
        initial concept for Iron Man.[1] Lee wanted to design a character who should have been unpalatable to his
        generally anti-war readers but to make them like the character anyway.[2] Iron Man was created in the years
        after a permanent arms industry developed in the United States, and this was incorporated into the character's
        backstory.[3] The character was introduced as an active player in the Vietnam War. Lee described the national
        mood toward Vietnam in which Iron Man was created as "a time when most of us genuinely felt that the conflict in
        that tortured land really was a simple matter of good versus evil".[4]</p>
    <h3>Technology</h3>
    <p>Technology and its influence on society is a common theme in Iron Man stories,[136][137] and Iron Man has been
        emphasized as a technological marvel since his earliest appearances.[138] Iron Man's use of technology reflects
        overall problems of progress and advancement. As he produces new technologies, he solves existing problems, but
        he also creates new ones. This applies both to his time as a weapons manufacturer and his role as Iron Man.</p>
    <h2>Cultural impact and legacy</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Iron Man's appearances in the 1960s saw mixed reception from readers, many of whom criticized the character for
        his association with the United States military and the controversial Vietnam War.[4][25] In response, Marvel
        rewrote the character in the 1970s to moderate his image and to have him directly reflect on his culpability in
        the harms caused by war</p>
